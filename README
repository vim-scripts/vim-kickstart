This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3817

This is a fork of vimscript #736 whose author is no longer maintaining it. My fork lives on GitHub here:

https://github.com/tangledhelix/vim-kickstart

This version adds comment/commenstring and format options, on top of the existing syntax file supplied by David Ne√ßas' original kickstart.vim script.
